 At the foot of the ladder, the lamb footbeds are only depressed in the surface about one or two inches. Although the surface appears to be very fine grained as you get close to it, it's almost like a powder. Down there is very fine. I'm going to step off the lamb now. That's one small step for man. One giant leap for mankind.
